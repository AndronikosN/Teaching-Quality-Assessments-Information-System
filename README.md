# Teaching-Quality-Assessments-Information-System
This project was created as part of my thesis. It is a system for creating questionnaires, answering them and displaying data and results.

## Tools I used
1. Vue.js (JavaScript Framework)
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. PHP
5. CoreUI (Bootstrap template)
6. Axios - Promise-based HTTP client
7. JWT (Json Web Token)
8. Node.js

## Folder src
In this folder you will find the vue code files. The containers created based on the type of user, the views and all the functions.
*All the axios requests are addressed to a local database*

## Folder restapi
In this folder you will find all the files created for the REST FULL Api my system uses.
- Folder config = Database connection
- Folder login = Files required for the login
- Folder Foithths, Omea, Modip = All the files for different types of users.

## Folder screenshots
In this folder you will find screenshots presenting the application.
*Some names are real people, so the names are blurred*
